### WORK EXPERIENCE

#### **BairesDev**  
*Senior Full-Stack .NET & Angular Engineer*  
*Feb 2025 – Present | Remote (Company HQ: New York, New York)*  

I'm currently building and improving features for a large-scale telematics and fleet management platform. My role covers the full stack, from implementing backend data processing to building the Angular UI.

*   Built a new Fuel Consumption Analysis feature from the ground up, allowing users to rank driver performance by shift, route, and vehicle. On the frontend, I used Angular Signals to create a responsive UI with multi-select and dependent filters for deep data exploration.
*   Developed the entire Driver Schedule management system. This included creating a full import/export pipeline for CSV/TXT files with client-side validation and an audit history view to track all changes and ensure data integrity.
*   On the backend, I wrote .NET 8 services that process real-time data streams from Azure Event Hubs These .services also handle background jobs and push the processed results into Google BigQuery, making the data available for analysis.
*   Beyond new features, I focus on code quality and stability. I regularly fix complex bugs (like data normalization issues in the AOD Odometer) and improve the codebase through refactoring, all while following team practices like Conventional Commits and a thorough Pull Request review process.
