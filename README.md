### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**BairesDev — Senior Full-Stack Engineer**  
*Remote | Jun 2022 – Present*  
Embedded engineering consultant for U.S.-based clients in long-term, fully remote engagements. Worked daily with product, QA, and engineering teams across U.S. time zones using Agile practices.

- **Enterprise Fleet Telematics Platform** *(U.S. Client | Remote | Feb 2025 – Present)*  
  Engineered core C# services to assign drivers to vehicle trips using raw telemetry from BigQuery. Built a shift management module that accepts operator schedules via CSV and developed a background service to correlate vehicle data with shifts, computing performance metrics (max/avg speed, fuel use, safety scores). Resolved data integrity issues caused by signal flicker and concurrent driver assignments through custom sanitization logic and conflict-resolution rules.

- **E-commerce Platform** *(U.S. Client | Remote | Jan 2023 – Jan 2025)*  
  Built a serverless image processing pipeline on AWS (Lambda, SQS, SNS) to auto-generate product collages. After discovering OpenCVSharp’s native dependencies were incompatible with Lambda, I redesigned the solution using SkiaSharp and a lightweight edge-detection algorithm—enabling reliable, scalable delivery of optimized assets to S3 for storefront use.

- **B2B Data Privacy & Compliance SaaS** *(U.S. Client | Remote | Jun 2022 – Jan 2023)*  
  Contributed to modernizing the data access layer by migrating from raw JDBC to Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA. Replaced string-based SQL queries with type-safe JPA repositories, helping eliminate SQL injection vulnerabilities and reducing error-prone connection management code. The new layer improved maintainability and supported future compliance features.

**GEOI2 Tecnologia — Software Engineer**  
*Remote/Hybrid | Aug 2019 – Jun 2022*  
- Replaced a high-risk legacy JSF application with a modern Angular 13 frontend, enabling broader team ownership and long-term maintainability.  
- Automated financial audit data collection across 79 municipalities by building a Java CLI tool that orchestrated Pentaho Kettle pipelines (Sybase, Firebird, PostgreSQL). Implemented Gzip compression to reduce payload size by 90%, ensuring reliable transfers over low-bandwidth networks.

**Fonte Tecnologia — Software Engineer**  
*Campo Grande, Brazil | Aug 2017 – Aug 2019*  
- Diagnosed and fixed a critical UI performance bottleneck in a real-time vehicle dispatch system (Knockout.js) by refactoring to event delegation and replacing `setTimeout` animations with `requestAnimationFrame`, restoring responsiveness at scale.  
- Developed an emergency call reporting module using .NET Web API and SQL Server.

**PSG Tecnologia — Software Engineer**  
*Campo Grande, Brazil | Mar 2013 – Aug 2017*  
- Built a legislative drafting and multi-year budgeting system for state government, modeling complex legal hierarchies (articles, sections, paragraphs) using a recursive SQL table structure.  
- Delivered a jQuery-based rich text editor and tree UI for managing hierarchical budget data, both backed by the same normalized schema.
