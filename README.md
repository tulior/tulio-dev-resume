#### WORK EXPERIENCE

**BairesDev** | Jun 2022 – Present  
**Full-Stack Software Engineer** | Remote

*As a consultant, I've delivered solutions for multiple clients across different technology stacks, with a primary focus on the .NET and Angular ecosystem.*

*   **Fuel Consumption Analysis Feature (.NET/Angular):** Built a new module for a fleet management platform to analyze fuel consumption by driver. I developed the .NET 8 APIs to process the data and the Angular 17 frontend to display it, which included a complex grid with multi-select filters. This feature gives clients the data they need to see which drivers are most efficient.
*   **Shift Finalization Background Service (.NET):** Created a .NET background service that processes vehicle data from Azure Event Hubs in near real-time. It aggregates trip metrics, finalizes driver shifts, and writes the results to BigQuery. This ensures our analytics dashboards are always working with accurate, up-to-date information.
*   **Shopify Integration Service (.NET):** Built a .NET microservice from the ground up to sync product and inventory data with Shopify's API. A key challenge was handling their API rate limits, which I solved using an SQS queue for batching updates. The service successfully onboarded over 50 retailers and processed 400+ orders in the first 8 months.
*   **Legacy API Modernization (Java/Spring):** In my initial engagement, I modernized a client's legacy Java APIs into Spring Boot REST services, improving database query performance and integrating the services into their CI/CD pipeline.

**Prior Engineering Experience | 2013 – 2022**  
**Software Engineer** | *Geoi2, Fonte Tecnologia, PSG Tecnologia*  

In foundational roles, I developed and maintained full-stack applications for public safety, state law management, and financial auditing. This period was focused on building core engineering skills, including performance optimization of real-time systems, legacy modernization, and delivering reliable features in .NET and Java environments.
