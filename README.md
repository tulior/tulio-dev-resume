# Túlio Ribeiro dos Anjos

## Full-Stack .NET & Cloud Developer  
Campo Grande, Brazil  - *Remote Only*  

### **Summary**  
I build scalable, high-performance systems with .NET. With over a decade of experience in C# and .NET, I’ve designed cloud-native applications, modernized legacy systems, and optimized real-time APIs. I’ve led e-commerce integrations at scale, built serverless architectures with AWS, and solved complex engineering problems in distributed systems. I focus on efficiency, maintainability, and software that lasts.

### Key Achievements

- **High-Scale Shopify Integration:** Developed an AWS Lambda-based integration in .NET 8 that synced over 100,000 SKUs, enabling a robust direct-to-consumer sales channel.
- **Real-Time Image Processing:** Engineered a high-performance image processing system using AWS Lambda and SkiaSharp, achieving sub-second response times for dynamic collage generation and enhancing user engagement.
- **Intelligent API Throttling:** Implemented advanced throttling with data diffing and retry mechanisms, reducing failure rates and ensuring smooth high-volume transactions.
- **Legacy Modernization:** Transformed a sluggish JSF application into a high-performance Angular 13 micro-frontend with a Spring Boot backend, significantly improving load times and overall user experience.
- **Critical System Optimization:** Eliminated a CPU bottleneck in a real-time emergency dispatch platform by refactoring inefficient timer logic, markedly improving WebSocket responsiveness and operational efficiency.
