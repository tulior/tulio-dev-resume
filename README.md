PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

BairesDev — Senior Full‑Stack Engineer
Remote | Jun 2022 – Present
Embedded on U.S. client teams; daily collaboration across time zones.

Enterprise Fleet Telematics Platform (U.S. Client | Feb 2025 – Present)

Designed and built the driver‑to‑trip assignment system, segmenting multi‑driver routes and recalculating fuel, distance, speed, and safety scores per segment so managers can attribute results to the right driver; handled noisy signals (card‑in/card‑out flicker, overlapping driver IDs) with validation/debounce to keep attribution trustworthy.

Added shift import and a background matcher (CSV → BigQuery) to align telemetry with operator schedules and surface driver performance in existing reports.


E‑commerce Platform (U.S. Client | Jan 2023 – Jan 2025)

Shipped an automated collage generator for product collections (2–4 images) with context‑aware cropping so storefront pages get consistent, useful visuals without manual editing.

Ran the process as a serverless job triggered on catalog updates; published optimized assets to S3/CDN and kept the pipeline predictable under load.


B2B Data Privacy & Compliance SaaS (U.S. Client | Jun 2022 – Jan 2023)

Moved ad‑hoc SQL to Spring Data JPA repositories, removing injection‑prone string queries and connection juggling so the team could add features safely.

Introduced clear data access boundaries and tests, which made the codebase easier to reason about and change.


GEOI2 Tecnologia — Software Engineer
Remote/Hybrid | Aug 2019 – Jun 2022

Replaced a single‑maintainer JSF app with an Angular 13 front end the whole team could support; preserved workflows, improved clarity, and unblocked changes.

Automated financial audit data collection for 79 municipalities with a Java CLI that ran Kettle pipelines and gzip compression, keeping transfers reliable on slow links.


Fonte Tecnologia — Software Engineer
Campo Grande, Brazil | Aug 2017 – Aug 2019

Restored UI responsiveness in a real‑time dispatch grid by consolidating event handling and moving animations to requestAnimationFrame; stayed smooth with hundreds of active jobs.


PSG Tecnologia — Software Engineer
Campo Grande, Brazil | Mar 2013 – Aug 2017

Built a legislative drafting and budgeting system for state government, modeling legal hierarchies with a recursive SQL schema.
