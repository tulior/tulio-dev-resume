### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**BairesDev — Software Engineer**  
*Remote | Jun 2022 – Present*  
Embedded on U.S. client teams; daily collaboration across time zones.

**Enterprise Fleet Telematics Platform** *(U.S. Client | Feb 2025 – Present)*
- Designed and built the driver-to-trip assignment system, segmenting multi-driver routes and recalculating fuel, distance, speed, and safety scores per segment so managers can attribute results to the right driver; handled noisy signals (card-in/card-out flicker, overlapping driver IDs) with validation/debounce to keep attribution trustworthy.
- Added shift import and a background matcher (CSV → BigQuery) to align telemetry with operator schedules and surface driver performance in existing reports.

**E-commerce Platform** *(U.S. Client | Jan 2023 – Jan 2025)*
- Shipped an automated collage generator for product collections (2–4 images) with context-aware cropping so storefront pages get consistent, useful visuals without manual editing.
- Ran the process as a serverless job triggered on catalog updates; published optimized assets to S3/CDN and kept the pipeline predictable under load.

**B2B Data Privacy & Compliance SaaS** *(U.S. Client | Jun 2022 – Jan 2023)*
- Moved ad-hoc SQL to Spring Data JPA repositories, removing injection-prone string queries and connection juggling so the team could add features safely.
- Introduced clear data access boundaries and tests, which made the codebase easier to reason about and change.

**GEOI2 Tecnologia — Software Engineer**  
*Remote/Hybrid | Aug 2019 – Jun 2022*
- Replaced a single-maintainer JSF app with an Angular 13 front end the whole team could support; preserved workflows, improved clarity, and unblocked changes.
- Automated financial audit data collection for 79 municipalities with a Java CLI that ran Kettle pipelines and gzip compression, keeping transfers reliable on slow links.

**Fonte Tecnologia — Software Engineer**  
*Campo Grande, Brazil | Aug 2017 – Aug 2019*
- Restored UI responsiveness in a real-time dispatch grid by consolidating event handling and moving animations to `requestAnimationFrame`; stayed smooth with hundreds of active jobs.

**PSG Tecnologia — Software Engineer**  
*Campo Grande, Brazil | Mar 2013 – Aug 2017*
- Built a legislative drafting and budgeting system for state government, modeling legal hierarchies with a recursive SQL schema.
